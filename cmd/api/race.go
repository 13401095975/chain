/*

Each build of api also produces a race-enabled binary.
See builds/api/build for the details.

To use this facility, log in to a machine, stop the
normal binary via upstart, and start the race-enabled
binary directly by loading the config vars and running
command 'api_race'. Race reports are printed to stderr.
See https://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html
for more info.
