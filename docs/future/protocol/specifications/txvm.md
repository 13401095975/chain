# TxVM

This is the specification for txvm, which combines a representation for blockchain transactions with the rules for ensuring their validity.

* [Motivation](#motivation)
* [TxVM operation](#txvm-operation)
* [Compatibility](#compatibility)
* [Types](#types)
* [Encoding](#encoding)
* [Stacks](#stacks)
* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [Examples](#examples)

## Motivation

Earlier versions of Chain Core represented transactions with a static data structure, exposing the pieces of information needed to test the transaction’s validity. A separate set of validation rules could be applied to that information to get a true/false result.

Under txvm, these functions are combined in such a way that an executable program string is both the transaction’s representation and the proof of its validity.

When the virtual machine executes a txvm program, it accumulates different types of data on different stacks. This data corresponds to the information exposed in earlier versions of the transaction data structure: inputs, outputs, time constraints, nonces, and so on. Under txvm, that information is _only_ available as a result of executing the program, and the program only completes without error if the transaction is well-formed (i.e., its inputs and outputs balance, prevout control programs are correctly satisfied, etc). No separate validation steps are required.

The pieces of transaction information - the inputs, outputs, etc. - that are produced during txvm execution are also _consumed_ in order to produce the transaction summary, which is the sole output of a successful txvm program. To capture pieces of transaction information for purposes other than validation, txvm implementations can and should provide callback hooks for inspecting and copying data from the various stacks at key points during execution.


## TxVM operation

Validation of the transaction happens in a context of a validating a block of transactions. Large part of that validation is handled by the TxVM logic with a few validation rules outside of it.

### Transaction version

TBD: how transaction version is specified and how `extension` flag is set.

Sketch:

1. New txvm txs will have version 2 to avoid confusion with txv1 (they have incompatible format, but still). 
2. Version 1 is prohibited in txvm.
3. Tx version can be unknown (>2) only if allowed by outer context (e.g. block version is unknown)
4. If tx version is unknown (>2) extension flag is set to true to allow NOPs and extends.

TBD: should we specify txversion inside the bytecode or in the container? E.g. we could have "transaction" tuple:

    {
      type:    "tx", 
      version: 2, 
      program: "...txvm bytecode..."
    }

### VM Execution

1. The VM is initialized with all stacks empty.
2. TXVM bytecode is being executed.
3. When the program counter is equal to the length of the program, execution is complete. 
4. The top item of the [Effect stack](#Effect) must be a [Transaction ID](#transaction-id).
5. There must be no other Transaction IDs in the Effect stack, otherwise execution fails.
6. There must be at least one [anchor](#anchor) in the Effect stack. 
7. The Entry stack must be empty.

### Post-execution

If execution and all the required checks do not fail, Effect stack is introspected and blockchain state is updated:

1. For each [Input](#input), its `contractid` is removed from the UTXO set.
2. For each [Output](#output), its `contractid` is added to the UTXO set.
3. Remove all outdated nonces from Nonce set (based on block's timestamp)
4. For each [Nonce](#nonce), add it's ID to the Nonce set.
5. TBD: records?


### Runlimit

The VM is initialized with a set runlimit. Each instruction reduces that number. If the runlimit goes below zero while the program counter is less than the length of the program, execution fails.

1. Each instruction costs `1`.
2. Each instruction that pushes an item to the data stack, including as the result of an operation (such as `add`, `cat`, `merge`, `field`, and `untuple`), costs an amount based on the type and size of that data:
  1. Each string that is pushed to the stack costs `1 + len`, where `len` is the length of that string in bytes.
  2. Each number that is pushed to the stack costs `1`.
  3. Each tuple that is pushed to the stack costs `1 + len`, where `len` is the length of that tuple.
3. Each instruction that pushes an item to any stack other than the data or alt stack costs `256` for each item so pushed.
4. Each `checksig` and `pointmul` instruction costs `1024`. [TBD: estimate the actual cost of these instruction relative to the other instructions].
5. Each `roll`, `bury`, or `reverse` instruction costs `n`, where `n` is the `n` argument to that operation.

TODO: suggestion - specify runlimit in the transaction structure. Consume that limit from the one declared in the block. Federation chooses appropriate limit and signs over it, preventing DoS (because tx ID is computed only via execution of txvm).


## Compatibility

### Spending legacy outputs

TBD: overview of the upgrade opcode

### Issuance of legacy Asset ID

TBD: Need compatibility layer to issue legacy asset IDs: specify the context for VM1 based on txvm tx.

### Confidential issuance of legacy Asset IDs

TBD: Need compatibility layer to use legacy asset IDs in the Issuance Candidates: also, specify necessary context for VM1 based on txvm tx.

### Soft-fork and hard-fork upgrades to TxVM

TBD: Need to specify how soft/hard fork upgrades are possible with NOPs and Extend opcode.



## Types

There are three types of items on the VM stacks, with the following numeric identifiers.

* Int64 (33)
* String (34)
* Tuple (35)

"Boolean" is not a separate type. Operations that produce booleans produce the two int64 values `0` (for false) and `1` (for true). Operations that consume booleans treat `0` as false, and all other values (including all strings and tuples) as `true`.

### Int64

An integer between 2^-63 and 2^63 - 1.

### String

A bytestring with length between 0 and 2^31 - 1 bytes.

Items on the alt stack have the same types as items on the data stack. The alt stack starts out empty. Items can be moved from the data stack to the alt stack with the [toaltstack](#toaltstack) instruction, and from the alt stack to the data stack with the [fromaltstack](#fromaltstack).

### Entry stack

Items on the Entry stack are [Values](#value).

## Instructions

## Control flow operations

### Fail

Halts VM execution, returning `false`.

### PC

Pushes the current program counter (after incrementing for this instruction) to the data stack.

### JumpIf

1. Pops an integer `destination` from the data stack.
2. Pops a boolean `cond` from the data stack. 
3. If `cond` is false, do nothing. 
4. If `cond` is true, set program counter to `destination`. 
5. Fail if `destination` is negative.
6. Fail if `destination` is greater than the length of the current program.

Note 1: normally the program using `jumpif` would be written as `<cond> <destination> jumpif` in assembly, but for brevity a slightly different syntax is used:

    <cond> jumpif:$<destination>

where `<destination>` is a name of a label somewhere in the program. The label itself is marked as `$<label>` among the instructions. Example:

    <cond> jumpif:$xyz  ... $xyz ...

Note 2: unconditional jump can be implemented with `jumpif` prefixed with "push 1" opcode: 

    1 jumpif:$<destination>


## Stack operations 

General stack operations intentionally do not allow adding or removing arbitrary items. Only data stack and altstack allow arbitrary manipulations (see [Data stack operations](#data-stack-operations)), other stacks employ specific validation rules for adding or removing individual elements.

  * `n` `prevac[i]` as previous asset ID commitments
  * `program` as the message signed by the range proof
8. Fails execution if verification of ARP fails.
9. Pushes asset commitment `ac` to the Entry stack.
10. Executes `program` via [command](#command) instruction.


### DropAssetCommitment

1. Pops an [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment) `ac` from the Entry stack.
2. Fails if top element is not an asset commitment.

Note: in principle, proven asset ID commitments on Entry stack do not have to be specially consumed (like values), and the same commitments are reused in multiple ARPs. So to satisfy the requirement of a clean Entry stack and avoid unnecesary duplication of asset commitments, in the end of transaction, this opcode allows cleaning up all remaining asset commitments.


### ProveAssetID

This opcode proves that a given cleartext asset ID is stored within a given [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment).

1. Pops string `assetproof` from the data stack.
2. Pops string `program` from the data stack.
3. Peeks at string `assetID` on the top the data stack.
4. Peeks at [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment) `ac` below `assetID` on the data stack.
5. [Verifies](ca.md#validate-asset-id-proof) the `assetproof` with the given `assetID` and commitment `ac`.
6. Executes `program` via [command](#command) instruction.


### ProveAmount

1. Pops string `amountproof` from the data stack.
2. Pops string `program` from the data stack.
3. Peeks at integer `amount` on the top the data stack.
4. Peeks at [Value Commitment](#value-commitment) `vc` below `amount` on the data stack.
5. Peeks at [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment) `ac` below `vc` on the data stack.
6. [Verifies](ca.md#validate-amount-proof) the `amountproof` string with the given `amount` and commitments `vc` and `ac`.
7. Executes `program` via [command](#command) instruction.


### ProveValueRange

1. Pops a string `valuerangeproof`.
2. Pops string `program` from the data stack.
3. Pops an item `value` of type [Unproven Value](#unproven-value) from the Entry stack.
4. Peeks at [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment) `ac` at the top of the Entry stack.
5. Verifies `valuerangeproof` with the given `value.valuecommitment`, `ac.assetcommitment` and `program` as a custom message.
6. Pushes a new [Proven Value](#proven-value) to the Entry stack with `newvalue.valuecommitment` set to `value.valuecommitment` and `newvalue.assetcommitment` set to the `ac.assetcommitment`.
7. Executes `program` via [command](#command) instruction.


### IssuanceCandidate

1. Pops a Public Key `issuancekey` from the data stack. 
2. Peeks at the top item on the Command stack, `command`. 
3. Computes the [ID](#item-ids) `assetid` of an [asset definition](#asset-definition) tuple with `issuanceprogram` set to `command.program`.
4. Pushes an [Issuance Candidate](#issuance-candidate) to Entry stack with the `assetid` and `issuancekey`.

TBD: this is incompatible with existing asset IDs. We need either support for legacy asset definitions, or another opcode `LegacyIssuanceCandidate` to create ICs from legacy asset ids.

### ConfidentialIssue

1. Pops from data stack (in order):
  * [Value Commitment](#value-commitment) `vc`
  * [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment) `ac`
  * string `program`
  * confidential IARP with `n` ring signature items
2. Pops `n` [Issuance Candidate](#issuance-candidate) items from Entry stack (`n` is the number of items in ring signature).
3. Verifies IARP using `ac`, `n` issuance candidates and a program as an IARP’s message.
4. Pushes asset commitment `ac` to the Entry stack.
5. Pushes new [Unproven Value](#unproven-value) with `valuecommitment` set to `vc` to the Entry stack.
6. Executes `program` via [command](#command) instruction.

Note: `ConfidentialIssue` authorized issuance of a certain asset commitment (within a given set of candidates) and a given value commitment. However, the value commitment must additionally be proven to be in range before it can be used. Program `program` allows issuer to commit to that value commitment, if needed.


## Anchor operations

### Nonce

1. Pops an int64 `min` from the data stack. 
2. Pops an int64 `max` from the data stack. 
3. Pops a string `blockchainid`.
4. Peeks at the top item on the Command stack, `command`.
5. Verifies that `blockchainid` is equal to the blockchain ID. 
6. Constructs a [Nonce](#nonce) `nonce` with:
  * `nonce.program` equal to `command.program`, 
  * `nonce.mintime` equal to `min`, 
  * `nonce.maxtime` equal to `max`. 
7. Pushes `nonce` to the Effect stack. 
8. Pushes an [anchor](#anchor) to the Entry stack with `value` equal to the [ID](#item-ids) of `nonce`. 
9. Pushes a [Mintime](#mintime) to the Effect stack with `mintime` equal to `nonce.mintime`. 
10. Pushes a [Maxtime](#maxtime) to the Effect stack with `maxtime` equal to `nonce.maxtime`.

### Reanchor

1. Pops an [anchor](#anchor) `anchor` from the Entry stack. 
2. Compute the [ID](#item-ids) of `anchor`, `anchorid`. 
3. Pushes a new anchor `newanchor`, with `newanchor.value` set to `anchorid`.

### Splitanchor

1. Pops an [anchor](#anchor) `anchor` from the Entry stack. 
2. Compute the [ID](#item-ids) of `anchor`, `anchorid`. 
3. Pushes a new anchor `newanchor01`, with `newanchor.value` set to `sha3("01" || anchorid)`. Pushes a new anchor `newanchor00`, with `newanchor.value` set to `sha3("00" || anchorid)`.

### Anchortransaction

Moves an [anchor](#anchor) `anchor` from the Entry stack to the Effect stack.



## Time operations

### Before

1. Pops an int64 `max` from the data stack.
2. Pushes a [Maxtime](#maxtime) to the [Effect stack](#Effect-stack) with `maxtime` equal to `max`.

### After

1. Pops an int64 `min` from the stack.
2. Pushes a [Mintime](#mintime) to the [Effect stack](#Effect-stack) with `mintime` equal to `min`.



## Conversion operations

### Summarize

1. Computes the [ID](#item-ids) of each item on the Effect stack. 
2. Creates a tuple of those IDs (with the first item first), `effectids`. 
3. Creates a tuple of type [Transaction Summary](#transaction-summary) `summary` with `effectids` equal to `effectids`. 
4. Computes the [ID](#item-id) `txid` of `summary`. 
5. Creates a tuple of type [Transaction ID](#transaction-id) on the Effect stack with `transactionid` equal to `transactionid`.

TODO: why do we need Tx Summary intermediate structure? It's more efficient to simply hash all item IDs into txid, w/o going through wrapping into a struct and using `encode`.

PROPOSAL: Alternative definition w/o Transaction Summary:

1. Computes the [ID](#item-ids) of each item on the Effect stack. 
2. Computes SHA3-256 hash `txid` of all IDs concatenated from top item on Effect stack to the bottom.
3. Creates a tuple of type [Transaction ID](#transaction-id) on the Effect stack with `transactionid` set to `txid`.


### Migrate

(TBD: update)

Pops a tuple of type [legacy output](#legacy-output) `legacy` from the data stack. Pushes it to the Effect stack. Pushes an [anchor](#anchor) to the Entry stack with `value` set to the old-style ID (TBD) of `legacy`.

[TBD: parse and translate the old-style program `legacy.program`, which must be a specific format, into a new one `newprogram`.]

Pushes a [Value](#value) with amount `legacy.amount` and asset ID `legacy.assetID` to the Entry stack.

Executes `newprogram`.

### Extend

Fails if the extension flag is not set. (TBD: clarify)

Pops an integer `stackid` from the data stack, representing a [stack identifier](#stacks). Pops an integer `depth` from the data stack. Pops an item, `extension`, from the data stack. On the stack identified by `stackid`, takes the `n`th tuple and replaces it with a copy of that tuple with one additional field added, containing `extension`.

(TBD: be precise about how cost accounting works for this. Do we even still need this and in what form?)


## Extension opcodes

### NOPs 0–9

Fails if the extension flag is not set. (TBD: clarify)

Have no effect when executed.

### Reserved

TODO: do we really need reserved opcodes? All NOPs are prohibited w/o "extensible" flag turned on (that is for unknown tx versions).

Causes the VM to halt and fail.



## Encoding opcodes

### Encode

Pops an item from the data stack. Pushes a string to the data stack which, if executed, would push that item to the data stack.

* **Strings** are encoded as a [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instruction which would push that string to the data stack. 
* **Integers** in range 0..32 (inclusive) are encoded as the appropriate [small integer](#small-integer) opcode. 
* **Other integers** (above 32 or negative) are encoded as [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instructions that would push the integer serialized as a [varint](#varint), followed by an [int64](#int64) instruction. 
* **Tuples** are encoded as a sequence of [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instructions that would push each of the items in the tuple in reverse order, followed by the instruction given by `encode(len)` where `len` is the length of the tuple, followed by the [tuple](#tuple).

### Int64

1. Pops a string `a` from the stack,
2. decodes it as a [signed varint](#varint),
3. pushes the result to the data stack as an Int64.

Fails execution when:

* `a` is not a valid varint encoding of an integer, 
* or the decoded `a` is greater than or equal to `2^63`.

### Small integers

TODO: Descriptions of opcodes that push the numbers 0-32 to the stack.

### Pushdata

[TBD: use Keith's method for this]
