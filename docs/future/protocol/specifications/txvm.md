# TxVM

This is the specification for txvm, which combines a representation for blockchain transactions with the rules for ensuring their validity.

## Motivation

Earlier versions of Chain Core represented transactions with a static data structure, exposing the pieces of information needed to test the transaction’s validity. A separate set of validation rules could be applied to that information to get a true/false result.

Under txvm, these functions are combined in such a way that an executable program string is both the transaction’s representation and the proof of its validity.

When the virtual machine executes a txvm program, it accumulates different types of data on different stacks. This data corresponds to the information exposed in earlier versions of the transaction data structure: inputs, outputs, time constraints, nonces, and so on. Under txvm, that information is _only_ available as a result of executing the program, and the program only completes without error if the transaction is well-formed (i.e., its inputs and outputs balance, prevout control programs are correctly satisfied, etc). No separate validation steps are required.

The pieces of transaction information - the inputs, outputs, etc. - that are produced during txvm execution are also _consumed_ in order to produce the transaction summary, which is the sole output of a successful txvm program. To capture pieces of transaction information for purposes other than validation, txvm implementations can and should provide callback hooks for inspecting and copying data from the various stacks at key points during execution.

# VM Execution

The VM is initialized with all stacks empty.

When the program counter is equal to the length of the program, execution is complete. The top item of the [Effect stack](#Effect) must be a [Transaction ID](#transaction-id), and there must be no other Transaction IDs in the Effect stack. There must be at least one [anchor](#anchor) in the Effect stack. The Entry stack must be empty.

# Transaction version

TBD: how transaction version is specified and how `extension` flag is set.

Sketch:

1. New txvm txs will have version 2 to avoid confusion with txv1 (they have incompatible format, but still). 
2. Version 1 is prohibited in txvm.
3. Tx version can be unknown (>2) only if allowed by outer context (e.g. block version is unknown)
4. If tx version is unknown (>2) extension flag is set to true to allow NOPs and extends.

TBD: should we specify txversion inside the bytecode or in the container? E.g. we could have "transaction" tuple:

    {
      type:    "tx", 
      version: 2, 
      program: "...txvm bytecode..."
    }


# Stacks

## Types

There are three types of items on the VM stacks, with the following numeric identifiers.

* Int64 (33)
* String (34)
* Tuple (35)

"Boolean" is not a separate type. Operations that produce booleans produce the two int64 values `0` (for false) and `1` (for true). Operations that consume booleans treat `0` as false, and all other values (including all strings and tuples) as `true`.

### Int64

An integer between 2^-63 and 2^63 - 1.

### String

A bytestring with length between 0 and 2^31 - 1 bytes.

### Tuple

An immutable collection of items of any type.

There are several named types of tuples.

#### Value

0. `type`, a string, "value"
1. `amount`, an int64
2. `assetID`, a string

#### Value Commitment

0. `type`, a string, "valuecommitment"
1. `rawvaluecommitment`, a raw [value commitment](ca.md#value-commitment) as described in [CA](ca.md) specification.

## Stack identifiers

0. Data stack
1. Alt stack
2. Entry stack
3. Command stack
4. Effect stack

## Data stack

Items on the data stack can be int64s, strings, or tuples.

### Alt stack

Items on the alt stack have the same types as items on the data stack. The alt stack starts out empty. Items can be moved from the data stack to the alt stack with the [toaltstack](#toaltstack) instruction, and from the alt stack to the data stack with the [fromaltstack](#fromaltstack).

### Entry stack

Items on the Entry stack are [Values](#value).

### Command stack

Items on the Command stack are [Commands](#command).

### Effect stack

Items on the Effect stack are [Inputs](#input), [Outputs](#output), [Reads](#read), [Nonces](#nonce), [Retirements](#retirement).

### Issuance candidates stack

Items on the Issuance candidates stack are [Issuance Candidates](#issuance-candidates).

# Encoding formats

## Varint

TODO: Describe rules for encoding and decoding unsigned varints.

## Point

See [Point](ca.md#point) definition in Confidential Assets specification.

## Point Pair

See [Point Pair](ca.md#point-pair) definition in Confidential Assets specification.

# Runlimit

The VM is initialized with a set runlimit. Each instruction reduces that number. If the runlimit goes below zero while the program counter is less than the length of the program, execution fails.

1. Each instruction costs `1`.
2. Each instruction that pushes an item to the data stack, including as the result of an operation (such as `add`, `cat`, `merge`, `field`, and `untuple`), costs an amount based on the type and size of that data:
  1. Each string that is pushed to the stack costs `1 + len`, where `len` is the length of that string in bytes.
  2. Each number that is pushed to the stack costs `1`.
  3. Each tuple that is pushed to the stack costs `1 + len`, where `len` is the length of that tuple.
3. Each instruction that pushes an item to any stack other than the data or alt stack costs `256` for each item so pushed.
4. Each `checksig` and `pointmul` instruction costs `1024`. [TBD: estimate the actual cost of these instruction relative to the other instructions].
5. Each `roll`, `bury`, or `reverse` instruction costs `n`, where `n` is the `n` argument to that operation.

TODO: suggestion - specify runlimit in the transaction structure. Consume that limit from the one declared in the block. Federation chooses appropriate limit and signs over it, preventing DoS (because tx ID is computed only via execution of txvm).


# Operations

## Control flow operations

### Fail

Halts VM execution, returning false.

### PC

Pushes the current program counter (after incrementing for this instruction) to the data stack.

### JumpIf

Pops an integer `destination`, then a boolean `cond` from the data stack. If `cond` is false, do nothing. If `cond` is true, set program counter to `destination`. Fail if `destination` is negative, if `destination` is greater than the length of the current program.

## Stack operations 

General stack operations intentionally do not allow adding or removing arbitrary items. Only data stack and altstack allow arbitrary manipulations (see [Data stack operations](#data-stack-operations)), other stacks employ specific validation rules for adding or removing individual elements.

### Roll

On the stack identified by `stackid`, moves the `n`th item from the top from its current position to the top of the stack.

Fails if `stackid` does not correspond to a valid stack, or if the stack has fewer than `n + 1` items.

### Bury

Pops an integer `stackid` from the data stack, representing a [stack identifier](#stacks), and pops a number `n` from the data stack. Fails if `stackid` refers to the Command stack or the Effect stack.

Fails if `i` is negative or greater than or equal to the number of fields in `tuple`.

Pushes the string `str[start:end]` (with the first character being the one at index `start`, and the second character being the one at index `end`).

### Blind

TBD

## Extension opcodes

### NOPs 0–9

Fails if the extension flag is not set. (TBD: clarify)

Have no effect when executed.

Causes the VM to halt and fail.

## Encoding opcodes

* **Strings** are encoded as a [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instruction which would push that string to the data stack. 
* **Integers** in range 0..32 (inclusive) are encoded as the appropriate [small integer](#small-integer) opcode. 
* **Other integers** (above 32 or negative) are encoded as [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instructions that would push the integer serialized as a [varint](#varint), followed by an [int64](#int64) instruction. 
* **Tuples** are encoded as a sequence of [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instructions that would push each of the items in the tuple in reverse order, followed by the instruction given by `encode(len)` where `len` is the length of the tuple, followed by the [tuple](#tuple).

### Int64

1. Pops a string `a` from the stack,
2. decodes it as a [signed varint](#varint),
3. pushes the result to the data stack as an Int64.

Fails execution when:

* `a` is not a valid varint encoding of an integer, 
* or the decoded `a` is greater than or equal to `2^63`.

### Small integers

TODO: Descriptions of opcodes that push the numbers 0-32 to the stack.

### Pushdata

[TBD: use Keith's method for this]

## Examples

### Normal transaction

TODO: fix now that Value, Anchor, and Condition stacks are merged
