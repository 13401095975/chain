# TxVM

This is the specification for TxVM, which combines a representation for blockchain transactions with the rules for ensuring their validity.

* [Motivation](#motivation)
* [TxVM operation](#txvm-operation)
* [Compatibility](#compatibility)
* [Types](#types)
* [Encoding](#encoding)
* [Stacks](#stacks)
* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [Examples](#examples)

## Motivation

Earlier versions of Chain Core represented transactions with a static data structure, exposing the pieces of information needed to test the transaction’s validity. A separate set of validation rules could be applied to that information to get a true/false result.

Under TxVM, these functions are combined in such a way that an executable program string is both the transaction’s representation and the proof of its validity. Executable program representing transaction is called [Transaction Witness](#transaction-witness), it contains all data and logic necessary to produce a finalized [Transaction](#transaction), including necessary signatures and range proofs.

When the virtual machine executes a TxVM program, it accumulates different types of data on different stacks. This data corresponds to the information exposed in earlier versions of the transaction data structure: inputs, outputs, time constraints, nonces, and so on. Under TxVM, that information is _only_ available as a result of executing the program, and the program only completes without error if the transaction is well-formed (i.e., its inputs and outputs balance, prevout control programs are correctly satisfied, etc). No separate validation steps are required.

The pieces of transaction information - the inputs, outputs, etc. - that are produced during TxVM execution are also _consumed_ in order to produce the [Transaction](#transaction) object, which is the sole output of a successful TxVM program. To capture pieces of transaction information for purposes other than validation, TxVM implementations can and should provide callback hooks for inspecting and copying data from the various stacks at key points during execution.



## TODO

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Review extensibility features (adding new fields to predefined types)

1. See [Extend](#extend) opcode.

### Tx merkle root - should be txid or the entire tx.

1. We need to commit to tx script and runlimit to prevent DoS attacks where clients execute modified programs and waste CPUs.
2. We need to commit to txid, so clients can inspect effects of the transaction w/o even transmitting full script and bulky signatures/rangeproofs.

Ideal merkle item contains the following data (this is a bit redundant and presented for illustration):

    merkle item = hash(txid || runlimit || hash(txscript) || hash(effects))

* `txid` is a canonical ID for use in the external systems. It should itself include `version,runlimit,effects` and must exclude `txscript` to not be malleable.
* `runlimit` is necessary to prevent large runlimit attacks (block signers sign over the committed runlimit)
* `txscript` is a witness of how transaction is formed and validated - contains all bulky signatures and rangeproofs
* `effects` is an actual outcome of the transaction that's needed for state updates (necessary for blockchain state machine, even if txscript is stripped)

This allows fetching raw txscript w/o redundant raw effects, or raw effects w/o bulky txscript (aka witness).

#### Suggestion 1: 

* TxSummary = {version, runlimit, hash(effects)}
* TxID = hash(TxSummary)
* TxWitness = {TxID, hash(Tx)}
* Tx = {version, runlimit, txscript}

The "tx" entity will be raw transaction, which can be transformed into TxSummary and to TxWitness. TxWitness is committed to the merkle root, from where one can extract
either TxSummary (via TxID) or raw transaction via its hash.

#### Suggestion 2:

Same as above structurally, but changing the names so TxID is not confused with hash(Tx) (as in suggestion above).

    s/TxSummary/Tx/ => result of the txvm is a transaction object; allows saying `hash(TxSummary) == TxID`
    s/Tx/TxWitness/ => raw script+version+runlimit is the witness, that yields a transaction object representing changes to the global state
    merkle item = SHA3-256(Tx.ID || TxWitness.ID) - simple: commit witness & transaction, symmetrical: can fetch either one of them.

### Remove unnecessary "txvm" prefix

We do not need a globally unique domain separator, we need in-protocol domain separators to disambiguate items (e.g. different kinds of tuples) 



### Legacy scripts and legacy asset IDs

1. Need to allow unlocking legacy outputs.
2. Need to issue legacy asset IDs in the new txvm transactions.
3. Need to create issuance candidates from the legacy asset IDs.

### Isolated program execution

Use case: smart contract needs to defer authorization to an opaque program and guarantee that it does not mess with the intermediate state in unauthorized manner.

Ideas:

1. Provide data and values to the program (sandboxed execution) - most robust
2. Have isolated altstack per command, move sensitive items over there before executing other commands - bandaiding

Problems:

1. How do we ensure the program is flexible enough? The nested program might also want to consume some inputs, issue something etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------








## TxVM operation

Validation of the transaction happens in a context of a validating a block of transactions. Large part of that validation is handled by the TxVM logic with a few validation rules outside of it.

### VM state

TxVM is a state machine consisting of:

1. [Stacks](#stacks):
  0. Data stack
  1. Alt stack
  2. Entry stack
  3. Command stack
  4. Effect stack
2. Extension flag (boolean)
3. Runlimit (int64).
4. [Transaction Witness](#transaction-witness) tuple.

### VM Execution

1. The VM is initialized with:
  * all [stacks](#stacks) empty,
  * `extension` flag set to true or false according to [transaction versioning](#versioning) rules,
  * `runlimit` set to the runlimit specified by the [transaction witness](#transaction-witness),
  * [transaction witness](#transaction-witness) set to the transaction witness being validated.
2. TxVM bytecode is being executed according to behaviour described per each [instruction](#instructions).
3. Each instruction consumes [runlimit](#runlimit). If TxVM runs out of runlimit before the end of the execution, execution fails.
4. When the program counter is equal to the length of the program, execution is complete.
5. The top item of the [Effect stack](#effect-stack) must be a [Transaction](#transaction).
6. There must be no other Transaction objects in the Effect stack, otherwise execution fails.
7. There must be at least one [anchor](#anchor) in the Effect stack.
8. The Entry stack must be empty.

Note: remaining runlimit in TxVM could be greater than 0: excess value is allowed for future extensions.

### Post-execution

If execution and all the required checks do not fail, Effect stack is introspected and blockchain state is updated.

1. If any [Mintime](#mintime) item on the Effect stack has `mintime` greater than the block’s timestamp, reject transaction.
2. If any [Maxtime](#maxtime) item on the Effect stack has `maxtime` less than the block’s timestamp, reject transaction.
3. [Transaction ID](#transaction-id) is computed as ID committed to the block as ID of the Transaction object.
4. For each [Input](#input), its `contractid` is removed from the UTXO set.
5. For each [Output](#output), its `contractid` is added to the UTXO set.
6. Remove all outdated nonces from Nonce set (based on block's timestamp).
7. For each [Nonce](#nonce):
  1. Verify that `nonce.blockchainid` is equal to the current blockchain ID.
  2. Add ID of the nonce to the Nonce set.
8. TBD: update record set


### Versioning

1. Every instance of Chain Core software defines **current block version** and **current transaction version**.
2. All TxVM [Transaction](#transaction) tuples must have transaction version 2 or greater. This is to avoid confusion with version 1 transactions in the legacy format.
3. All TxVM [Block](#block) tuples must have version 2 or greater. This is to avoid confusion with version 1 blocks in the legacy format.
4. Blocks that include TxVM transactions must have version 2 or greater.
5. Each block must have the same version or greater as the previous block.

Extensions:

1. If the block version is equal to _current block version_, transaction cannot have version higher than the _current transaction version_.
2. If the transaction version is higher than the _current transaction version_, TxVM `extension` flag is set to `true`.
3. Otherwise, `extension` flag is set to `false`.


### Runlimit

Blocks commit to the total runlimit that be greater or equal to the sum of runlimits specified in all transactions within a block. Excess runlimit is allowed for future extensions.

The TxVM is initialized with a runlimit specified in [Transaction](#transaction) tuple. Each instruction reduces that number.

If the runlimit goes below zero while the program counter is less than the length of the program, execution fails.

1. Each instruction costs `1`.
2. Each instruction that pushes an item to the data stack, including as the result of an operation (such as `add`, `cat`, `merge`, `field`, and `untuple`), costs an amount based on the type and size of that data:
  1. Each string that is pushed to the stack costs `1 + len`, where `len` is the length of that string in bytes.
  2. Each number that is pushed to the stack costs `1`.
  3. Each tuple that is pushed to the stack costs `1 + len`, where `len` is the length of that tuple.
3. Each instruction that pushes an item to any stack other than the data or alt stack costs `256` for each item so pushed.
4. Each `checksig` and `pointmul` instruction costs `1024`. [TBD: estimate the actual cost of these instruction relative to the other instructions].
5. Each `roll`, `bury`, or `reverse` instruction costs `n`, where `n` is the `n` argument to that operation.

Execution of the transaction can leave some runlimit unconsumed: excess runlimit is allowed for future extensions.

## Compatibility

TxVM transactions are not compatible with version 1 transactions. However, they allow interacting with pre-existing blockchain state: nonces, outputs and asset IDs.

### Spending legacy outputs

See [UnlockLegacy](#unlocklegacy) instruction that allows unlocking value stored in [legacy outputs](#legacy-output).

### Issuance of legacy Asset ID

See [IssueLegacy](#issuelegacy) instruction that allows issuing value based on legacy asset IDs.

### Confidential issuance of legacy Asset IDs

See [LegacyIssuanceCandidate](#legacyissuancecandidate) instruction that allows creating an issuance candidate for the legacy asset IDs.

### Soft-fork and hard-fork upgrades to TxVM

Blocks, transactions and TxVM instructions are designed with extensibility in mind.

Upgrades can be done via hard forks and soft forks.

TBD: Need to specify how soft/hard fork upgrades are possible with NOPs and Extend opcode.



## Types

There are three types of items on the VM stacks, with the following numeric identifiers.

* Int64 (33)
* String (34)
* Tuple (35)

"Boolean" is not a separate type. Operations that produce booleans produce the two int64 values `0` (for false) and `1` (for true). Operations that consume booleans treat `0` as false, and all other values (including all strings and tuples) as `true`.

### Int64

An integer between 2^-63 and 2^63 - 1.

### String

A bytestring with length between 0 and 2^31 - 1 bytes.

### Item IDs

The ID of an item is the SHA3 hash of `"txvm" || encode(item)`, where `encode` is the [encode](#encode) operation.

### Transaction ID

The ID of a [Transaction](#transaction) object:

    SHA3-256("txvm" || encode(transaction))

### Tuple

An immutable collection of items of any type.

There are several named types of tuples.

For extensibility, each tuple may contain additional fields that are not defined yet.
These fields contribute to the tuple [ID](#item-ids), but do not affect the execution of TxVM.

### Block

1. `type`, a string, "block"
2. `version`, an int64
3. `previous`, a string, 32-byte ID of the previous block (or hash of a legacy block)
4. `predicate`, a tuple of 1 or more tuples of 1 one or more [Multisig Predicates](#multisig-predicate). Outer tuple is OR function, inner tuples are AND functions of the multisig predicates.
5. `runlimit`, an int64
6. `txroot`, a string, a merkle root of a set of all transactions included in the block, where each item is defined as:
        
        item = SHA3-256(Transaction.id || TransactionWitness.id)

7. TBD: UTXO & nonces set merkle root
8. TBD: records set merkle root (maybe the same root as utxo and nonces?)

### Signed Block

1. `type`, a string, "signedblock"
2. `block`, a tuple of type [Block](#block)
3. TBD: `signatures`, a tuple of tuples of tuples of signatures matching the format of the predicate.

Note: Signed Block is used to encode signatures for the block. The ID of the Signed Block is not used to prevent malleability of the blocks.

### Transaction Witness

0. `type`, a string, "txwitness"

1. `version`, an int64
2. `runlimit`, an int64

### Entry stack

Items on the Entry stack are [Values](#value).

### Command stack

Items on the Command stack are currently executed [Programs](#program).

### Effect stack

Items on the Effect stack are [Inputs](#input), [Outputs](#output), [Reads](#read), [Nonces](#nonce), [Retirements](#retirement).






## Instructions

## Control flow operations

### Fail

Halts VM execution, returning `false`.

### PC

Pushes the current program counter (after incrementing for this instruction) to the data stack.

### JumpIf

1. Pops an integer `destination` from the data stack.
2. Pops a boolean `cond` from the data stack.
3. If `cond` is false, do nothing.
4. If `cond` is true, set program counter to `destination`.
5. Fail if `destination` is negative.
6. Fail if `destination` is greater than the length of the current program.

Note 1: normally the program using `jumpif` would be written as `<cond> <destination> jumpif` in assembly, but for brevity a slightly different syntax is used:

    <cond> jumpif:$<destination>

where `<destination>` is a name of a label somewhere in the program. The label itself is marked as `$<label>` among the instructions. Example:

    <cond> jumpif:$xyz  ... $xyz ...

Note 2: unconditional jump can be implemented with `jumpif` prefixed with "push 1" opcode:

    1 jumpif:$<destination>


## Stack operations

General stack operations intentionally do not allow adding or removing arbitrary items. Only data stack and altstack allow arbitrary manipulations (see [Data stack operations](#data-stack-operations)), other stacks employ specific validation rules for adding or removing individual elements.

## Condition operations

### Defer

1. Pops a [Program](#program) from the data stack.

10. Executes `program` via [command](#command) instruction.


### DropAssetCommitment

1. Pops an [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment) `ac` from the Entry stack.
2. Fails if top element is not an asset commitment.

Note: in principle, proven asset ID commitments on Entry stack do not have to be specially consumed (like values), and the same commitments are reused in multiple ARPs. So to satisfy the requirement of a clean Entry stack and avoid unnecesary duplication of asset commitments, in the end of transaction, this opcode allows cleaning up all remaining asset commitments.


### ProveAssetID

### IssueConfidential

1. Pops from data stack (in order):
  * [Value Commitment](#value-commitment) `vc`
  * [Asset Commitment](#asset-commitment) `ac`

3. Verifies IARP using `ac`, `n` issuance candidates and a program as an IARP’s message.
4. Pushes asset commitment `ac` to the Entry stack.
5. Pushes new [Unproven Value](#unproven-value) with `valuecommitment` set to `vc` to the Entry stack.
6. Executes `program` via [command](#command) instruction.

Note: `IssueConfidential` authorized issuance of a certain asset commitment (within a given set of candidates) and a given value commitment. However, the value commitment must additionally be proven to be in range before it can be used. Program `program` allows issuer to commit to that value commitment, if needed.

## Conversion operations

### Finalize

1. Fails if transaction was already finalized.
2. Hashes encoded items on Effect stack from bottom to the top (see [Encode](#encode) instructions) using SHA3-256:

3. Creates a tuple of type [Transaction](#transaction) `tx` with:
  * `tx.version` equal to version specified in [Transaction Witness](#transaction-witness) tuple.
  * `tx.runlimit` equal to runlimit specified in [Transaction Witness](#transaction-witness) tuple.
  * `tx.effecthash` equal to `h`.
4. Pushes `tx` to the Effect stack.

Note: hashed items are unambiguously encoded, so the `effecthash` is equivalent to the hash of the items’ IDs, but avoid unnecessary memory and CPU overhead for multiple hash instances.

### UnlockLegacy

1. Pops a tuple of type [Legacy Output](#legacy-output) `legacy` from the data stack.
2. Computes legacy Output ID. TBD: specifics
3. Pushes an [Input](#input) to the Effect stack with `contractid` equal to the legacy output ID.
4. Constructs a tuple `a` of type [Anchor](#anchor) with `a.value` equal to the legacy output ID.
5. Pushes `a` to the Entry stack.
6. Constructs [Value](#value) tuple with the amount and asset ID specified in the legacy output, and pushes it to the Entry stack.
7. Instantiates legacy [VM1](vm1.md) with the following context:
  * `vm1.amount` set to the amount in the legacy output.
  * `vm1.assetid` set to the asset ID in the legacy output.
  * `vm1.entryid` set to the legacy output ID.
  * `vm1.txid` left until evaluation 
  * 
  * TBD: need to defer this until txid is computed via `finalize`
8. TBD Alternatively: parse and translate the old-style program `legacy.program`, which must be a specific format, into a new one `newprogram`.
9. Defers execution of the legacy program. (TBD)

### IssueLegacy

TBD: Need compatibility layer to issue legacy asset IDs: specify the context for VM1 based on txvm tx.

### LegacyIssuanceCandidate

TBD: Need compatibility layer to use legacy asset IDs in the Issuance Candidates: also, specify necessary context for VM1 based on txvm tx.


### Extend

TBD: review this

1. Fails if the `extension` flag is `false`.
2. Pops an integer `stackid` from the data stack, representing a [stack identifier](#stacks). 
3. Pops an integer `depth` from the data stack.
4. Pops an item, `extension`, from the data stack.
5. On the stack identified by `stackid`, takes the `n`th tuple and replaces it with a copy of that tuple with one additional field added, containing `extension`.

(TBD: be precise about how cost accounting works for this. Do we even still need this and in what form?)


### Extension opcodes

All non-assigned opcodes are NOPs (no effect).

Execution of a NOP fails the VM execution if the `extension` flag is `false`.

Have no effect when executed.


## Encoding opcodes

### Encode

Pops an item from the data stack. Pushes a string to the data stack which, if executed, would push that item to the data stack.

* **Strings** are encoded as a [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instruction which would push that string to the data stack.
* **Integers** in range 0..32 (inclusive) are encoded as the appropriate [small integer](#small-integer) opcode.
* **Other integers** (above 32 or negative) are encoded as [Pushdata](#Pushdata) instructions that would push the integer serialized as a [varint](#varint), followed by an [int64](#int64) instruction.
* **Tuples** are encoded recursively as the encoding of each item in the tuple in reverse order, followed by the encoding of `len` where `len` is the length of the tuple, followed by the [tuple](#tuple) instruction.

### Int64

1. Pops a string `a` from the stack,
2. decodes it as a [signed varint](#varint),
3. pushes the result to the data stack as an Int64.

Fails execution when:

* `a` is not a valid varint encoding of an integer,
* or the decoded `a` is greater than or equal to `2^63`.

### Small integers

TODO: Descriptions of opcodes that push the numbers 0-32 to the stack.

### Pushdata

[TBD: use Keith's method for this]
