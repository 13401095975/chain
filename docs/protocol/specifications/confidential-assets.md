## Introduction

In Chain Protocol 2, asset IDs and amounts in transaction inputs and outputs can be kept private. These details are encrypted homomorphically: the network can verify that transactions are balanced (and, consequently, that the ledger is consistent) without learning exact asset IDs or amounts. Designated recipients and auditors share the encryption key that gives them “read access” to the asset ID and amount of a particular output.

Blinded amounts can be selectively revealed to the network in order to make them visible to smart contracts. The asset ID and the amount can be hidden or revealed independently enabling fine-grained privacy control.

Amounts can have *absolute privacy*, independent of the structure and history of any given transaction. Asset IDs are *relatively private*, meaning their privacy set is the union of the sets of possible asset IDs committed to by transaction inputs.

[[NOTES: Define absolute privacy. Define privacy set.]]

Cryptographic proofs for blinded asset IDs and blinded amounts require relatively large amounts of data (typically 3 to 5 KB). However, almost 80% of that space can be reused to encrypt a confidential message addressed to a designated recipient of the transaction output. The protocol specifies algorithms for encrypting and decrypting this data, along with parameters that allow the user creating the transaction to tune the size of the proofs trading off some of the privacy for lower bandwidth requirements (e.g. blinding a 32-bit amount requires half as much data compared to blinding a full-resolution 64-bit integer).

This scheme provides information-theoretic privacy, meaning that amounts and asset IDs would remain private even against an adversary with unbounded computational power, or a quantum computer that can efficiently solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). In other words, the scheme is perfectly *hiding*. As a necessary consequence, however, the scheme is not perfectly *binding* — if the ECDLP ceases to be computationally hard, a party could, in effect, freely change the asset ID or amount of blinded outputs. To protect against this possibility, the protocol defines provisional hash-based commitments to both asset ID and amount. If elliptic curve cryptography ceases to be secure, a protocol rule could be introduced (via a soft fork) that requires that transactions spending blinded outputs also publicly reveal values satisfying these hash-based commitments. The scheme allows keeping the encrypted message private even if the asset ID and amount are revealed.

## Usage

In this section we will provide a brief overview of various ways to use confidential assets.

### Confidential issuance

1. Issuer chooses asset ID and an amount to issue.
2. Issuer generates issuance [REK](#record-encryption-key) unique for this issuance.
3. Issuer chooses a set of other asset IDs to add into the *issuance anonymity set*.
4. Issuer sorts the union of the issuance asset ID and anonymity set lexicographically.
5. For each asset ID, where issuance program does not check an issuance key, issuer [creates a transient issuance key](#create-transient-issuance-key).
6. Issuer provides arguments for each issuance program of each asset ID.
7. Issuer [encrypts issuance](#encrypt-issuance): generates asset ID and value commitments and provides necessary range proofs.
8. Issuer remembers values `(H,c,f)` to help complete the transaction. Once outputs are fully or partially specified, these values can be discarded.
9. Issuer proceeds with the rest of the transaction creation. See [simple transfer](#simple-transfer) and [multi-party transaction](#multi-party-transaction) for details.

### Simple transfer

1. Recipient generates the following parameters and sends them privately to the sender:
    * amount and asset ID to be sent,
    * control program,
    * [REK1](#record-encryption-key).
2. Sender composes a transaction with an unencrypted output with a given control program.
3. Sender adds necessary amount of inputs to satisfy the output:
    1. For each unspent output, sender pulls values `(assetid,value,H,c,f)` from its DB.
    2. If the unspent output is not confidential, then:
        * `H=8*Decode(SHA3(assetid))`, [unblinded asset id commitment](#unblinded-asset-id-commitment)
        * `c=0`
        * `f=0`
    3. Values `(aek,vek)` can be discarded once the output is spent on the blockchain. These are kept for PQ event in case the spender will have to prove hash-based commitments to `c` and `f` blinding factors.
4. If sender needs to add a change output:
    1. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the first output.
    2. Sender [balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) to create an excess factor `q`.
    3. Sender adds unencrypted change output.
    4. Sender generates a [REK2](#record-encryption-key) for the change output.
    5. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the change output with an additional excess factor `q`.
5. If sender does not need a change output:
    1. Sender [balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) of the inputs to create an excess factor `q`.
    2. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the first output with an additional excess factor `q`.
6. Sender stores values `(assetid,value,H,c,f,aek,vek)` in its DB with its change output for later spending.
7. Sender publishes the transaction.
8. Recipient receives the transaction and identifies its output via its control program.
9. Recipient uses its [REK1](#record-encryption-key) to [decrypt output](#decrypt-output).
10. Recipient stores resulting `(assetid,value,H,c,f,aek,vek)` in its DB with its change output for later spending.
11. Recipient separately stores decrypted plaintext payload with the rest of the reference data. It is not necessary for spending.


### Multi-party transaction

1. All parties communicate out-of-band payment details (how much is being paid for what), but not cryptographic material or control programs.
2. Each party:
    1. Generates cleartext outputs: (amount, asset ID, control program, [REK](#record-encryption-key)). These include both requested payment ("I want to receive €10") and the change ("I send back to myself $142").
    2. [Encrypts](#encrypt-output) each output.
    3. [Balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) to create an excess factor `q[i]`.
    4. For each output, stores values `(assetid,value,H,c,f,aek,vek)` associated with that output in its DB for later spending.
    5. Sends `q[i]` to the party that finalizes transaction.
3. Party that finalizes transaction:
    1. Receives `{q[i]}` values from all other parties (including itself).
    2. Sums all excess factors: `qsum = ∑q[i]`
    3. [Creates excess commitment](#create-excess-commitment) out of `qsum`: `Q = qsum·G` and signs it.
    4. Finalizes transaction by placing the excess commitment to the Common Fields.
    5. Publishes the transaction.
4. If the amounts and blinding factors are balanced, transaction is valid and included in the blockchain. Parties can not see each other’s outputs, but only their own.


## Definitions

### Elliptic Curve Parameters

**The elliptic curve** is edwards25519 as defined by [[RFC7748](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748)].

Elliptic curve **point operations** `A+B`, `A-B` and scalar multiplication `a·B` are defined as in \[[CFRG1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-eddsa-05)\].

**Encoding** for 32-byte scalars and public keys is defined as in \[[CFRG1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-eddsa-05)\].

`L` is the **order of edwards25519** as defined by \[[CFRG1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-eddsa-05)\] (i.e. 2<sup>252</sup>+27742317777372353535851937790883648493).

`G` is the **standard generator point** on the elliptic curve specified as "B" in Section 5.1 of [[CFRG1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-eddsa-05)].


### Ring Signature

Ring signature is a variable-length string representing a signature of knowledge of a one private key among an ordered set of public keys (specified separately). In other words, ring signature implements an OR function of the public keys: “I know the private key for A, or B or C”. Ring signatures are used in [asset range proofs](#asset-range-proof).

The ring signature is encoded as a string of `n+1` 32-byte elements where `n` is the number of public keys provided separately (typically stored or imputed from the data structure containing the ring signature):

    {e, s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1]}

Each 32-byte element is an integer coded using little endian convention. I.e., a 32-byte string `x` `x[0],...,x[31]` represents the integer `x[0] + 2^8 · x[1] + ... + 2^248 · x[31]`.


### Borromean Ring Signature

Borromean ring signature ([[Maxwell2015](https://github.com/Blockstream/borromean_paper)]) is a data structure representing several [ring signatures](#ring-signature) compactly joined with an AND function of the ring signatures: “I know the private key for (A or B) and (C or D)”. Borromean ring signatures are used in [value range proofs](#value-range-proof) that prove the range of multiple digits at once.

The borromean ring signature is encoded as a sequence of 32-byte elements.

    {e, s[i,j]...}

Where:

* `i` is in range `0..n` where `n` is the number of rings.
* `j` is in range `0..m` where `m` is the number of signatures per ring.

Example: a [value range proof](#value-range-proof) for a 4-bit mantissa has 9 elements in its borromean ring signature:

    {
      e,
      s[0,0], s[0,1], s[0,2], s[0,3], # base-4 digit at position 0 (proof for the lower two bits)
      s[1,0], s[1,1], s[1,2], s[1,3], # base-4 digit at position 1 (proof for the higher two bits)
    }



### Asset ID Commitment

An asset ID commitment `H` is a point on Curve25519 encoded as a 32-byte string as specified in [[CFRG1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-eddsa-05)].

The asset ID commitment can either be nonblinded (clear) or blinded (confidential):

* [Create Nonblinded Asset ID Commitment](#create-nonblinded-asset-id-commitment)
* [Create Blinded Asset ID Commitment](#create-blinded-asset-id-commitment)

Note: even if the asset ID is provided in the clear, the corresponding nonblinded asset ID commitment is necessary for algorithms that validate the transaction as a whole.

Asset ID commitments are pedersen commitments as described in [[CITATION]].


### Encrypted Asset ID

A 64-byte string consisting of two encrypted elements: [asset ID](data.md#asset-id) and [its blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) (32 bytes each).

These values are present in the [output commitment](data.md#transaction-output-commitment) along with the [asset range proof](#asset-range-proof). The encrypted asset ID can be decrypted and verified by the recipient against the declared [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment). It also serves as an additional hash-based commitment in case ECDLP ceases to be computationally infeasible.


### Asset ID Descriptor

Asset ID Descriptor is a data structure that contains either a cleartext [asset ID](data.md#asset-id), or a pair of [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) with [encrypted asset ID](#encrypted-asset-id). Asset ID Descriptors represent asset ID in outputs and issuance inputs.

Asset ID Descriptor may contain _nonblinded_, _blinded_ or _blinded+encrypted_ asset ID as indicated by its 1-byte field `type`.

#### Nonblinded Asset ID Descriptor

Field                | Type     | Description
---------------------|----------|------------------
Type                 | byte     | Contains value 0x00 if asset ID is not blinded.
Asset ID             | sha3-256 | Cleartext asset ID.

#### Blinded Asset ID Descriptor

Field                | Type     | Description
---------------------|----------|------------------
Type                 | byte     | Contains value 0x01 if asset ID is blinded, but encrypted portion is not stored (used in issuance inputs).
Asset ID Commitment  | [Asset ID Commitment](#asset-id-commitment)  | 32-byte [public key](#public-key) representing asset ID commitment.

#### Encrypted Asset ID Descriptor

Field                | Type     | Description
---------------------|----------|------------------
Type                 | byte     | Contains value 0x03 if asset ID is both blinded and encrypted.
Asset ID Commitment  | [Asset ID Commitment](#asset-id-commitment)  | 32-byte [public key](#public-key) representing asset ID commitment.
Encrypted Asset ID   | [Encrypted Asset ID](#encrypted-asset-id) | 64-byte sequence representing encrypted asset ID (32 bytes) and its [blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) (32 bytes).


### Asset Range Proof

The asset range proof demonstrates that a given [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) commits to one of the asset IDs specified in the transaction inputs. A separate [validation procedure](validation.md#check-transaction-is-well-formed) makes sure that all of the declared asset ID commitments in fact belong to the transaction inputs.

Field                        | Type      | Description
-----------------------------|-----------|------------------
Asset ID Commitments Count   | varint31  | Number of input [asset ID commitments](#asset-id-commitment) used in the range proof.
Asset ID Commitments         | [[Asset ID Commitment](#asset-id-commitment)] | List of asset ID commitments from the transaction inputs.
Asset Ring Signature         | [Ring Signature](#ring-signature) | A ring signature proving that the asset ID committed in the output belongs to the set of declared input commitments.


### Value Commitment

Value pedersen commitment is a point on Curve25519 encoded as a 32-byte string as specified in [[CFRG1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-eddsa-05)].

Cleartext value commitment is simply a value multiplied by the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment):

    V = value·H

Confidential value commitment also contains a blinding factor `f`:

    V = value·H + f·G

Where:

* `V` is the value commitment,
* `value` is the 64-bit integer representing the amount,
* `H` is an [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment),
* `f` is a [value blinding factor](#value-blinding-factor) (could be different from the blinding integer in the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment)),
* `G` is the [standard generator point](#elliptic-curve-parameters) on the elliptic curve specified as "B" in Section 5.1 of [[CFRG1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-eddsa-05)].

Blinded value commitments in transaction outputs created individually using [Create Blinded Value Commitment](#create-blinded-value-commitment) algorithm. Balancing excess commitment is created using [Balance Blinding Factors](#balance-blinding-factors) algorithm.


### Encrypted Value

A 40-byte string consisting of two encrypted elements: amount (8 bytes) and [value blinding factor](#value-blinding-factor) (32 bytes).

These values are present in the [output commitment](data.md#transaction-output-commitment) along with the [value range proof](#asset-range-proof). Encrypted value can be decrypted and verified by the recipient against the [value commitment](#value-commitment). It also serves as an additional hash-based commitment in case ECDLP ceases to be computationally infeasible.


### Value Descriptor

Value Descriptor is a data structure that contains either a cleartext [asset ID](data.md#asset-id), or a pair of [value commitment](#value-commitment) with [encrypted value](#encrypted-value). Value Descriptors represent amounts in outputs and issuance inputs.

Value Descriptor may contain _nonblinded_, _blinded_ or _blinded+encrypted_ value as indicated by its 1-byte field `type`.

#### Nonblinded Value Descriptor

Field                | Type     | Description
---------------------|----------|------------------
Type                 | byte     | Contains value 0x00 if amount is not blinded.
Amount               | varint63 | Cleartext amount.

#### Blinded Value Descriptor

Field                | Type     | Description
---------------------|----------|------------------
Type                 | byte     | Contains value 0x01 if the amount is blinded, but encrypted portion is not stored (used in issuance inputs).
Value Commitment     | [Value Commitment](#value-commitment)  | 32-byte [public key](#public-key) representing value commitment.

#### Encrypted Value Descriptor

Field                | Type     | Description
---------------------|----------|------------------
Type                 | byte     | Contains value 0x03 if the amount is both blinded and encrypted.
Value Commitment     | [Value Commitment](#value-commitment)  | 32-byte [public key](#public-key) representing value commitment.
Encrypted Value      | [Encrypted Value](#encrypted-value) | 40-byte sequence representing encrypted value (8 bytes) and its blinding factor (32 bytes).


### Excess Factor

Excess factor is a scalar value representing a net difference between input and output blinding factors. It is computed using [Balance Blinding Factors](#balance-blinding-factors) and used to create an [Excess Commitment](#excess-commitment).


### Excess Commitment

Excess commitment is a 96-byte string encoding 3 elements: a public key `Q = q·G` and two 32-byte elements comprising a Schnorr signature `(e, s)`: `s = nonce + q·e; e = SHA3-256(Q || nonce·G)`.

Excess public key `Q` is used to [verify balance of value commitments](#verify-value-commitments-balance) while the associated signature proves that `Q` does not contain a factor affecting the amount of any asset (see [Verify Excess Commitment](#verify-excess-commitment)).


### Value Proof

Value proof demonstrates that a given [value commitment](#value-commitment) encodes a specific value and asset ID. It is used to privately prove the contents of an output without revealing blinding factors.


### Value Range Proof

Value range proof demonstrates that a [value commitment](#value-commitment) encodes a value between 0 and 2<sup>63</sup>–1. The 63-bit limit is chosen for consistency with the numeric limits defined for the asset version 1 outputs and VM version 1 [numbers](vm1.md#vm-number).

For the most compact encoding, value range proof uses base-4 digits represented by 4-key ring signatures proving the value of each pair of bits. If the number of bits is odd, the last ring signature contains only 2 elements proving the value of the highest-order bit. All ring signatures share the same e-value (see below) forming a so-called "[borromean ring signature](#borromean-ring-signature)".

Value range proof allows a space-privacy tradeoff by making a smaller number of bits confidential while exposing a "minimum value" and a decimal exponent. The complete value is broken down in the following components:

    value = vmin + (10^exp)·(d[0]·(4^0) + ... + d[m-1]·(4^(m-1)))

Where d<sub>i</sub> is the i’th digit in a m-digit mantissa (that has either 2·m–1 or 2·m bits). Exponent `exp` and the minimum value `vmin` are public and by default set to zero by the user creating the transaction.

Field                     | Type      | Description
--------------------------|-----------|------------------
Number of bits            | byte      | Integer `n` indicating number of confidential mantissa bits between 1 and 63.
Exponent                  | byte      | Integer `exp` indicating the decimal exponent from 0 to 10.
Minimum value             | varint63  | Minimum value `vmin` from 0 to 2<sup>63</sup>–1.
Digit commitments         | [pubkey]  | List of `(n+1)/2 – 1` individual digit pedersen commitments where `n` is the number of mantissa bits.
Borromean Ring Signature  | [Borromean Ring Signature](#borromean-ring-signature) | List of all 32-byte elements comprising all ring signatures proving the value of each digit.

The total number of elements in the [Borromean Ring Signature](#borromean-ring-signature) is `1 + 4·n/2` where `n` is number of bits and `n/2` is a number of rings.

### Record Encryption Key

Record encryption key (REK or `rek`) is a cryptographically-random 32-byte string unique to a given transaction output.

It is used to decrypt the payload data from the [value range proof](#value-range-proof), and derive [asset ID encryption key](#asset-id-encryption-key) and [value encryption key](#value-encryption-key).


### Intermediate Encryption Key

Intermediate encryption key (IEK or `iek`) allows decrypting the asset ID and the value in the output commitment. It is derived from the [record encryption key](#record-encryption-key) as follows:

    iek = SHA3-256(0x00 || rek)


### Asset ID Encryption Key

Asset ID encryption key (AEK or `aek`) allows decrypting the asset ID in the output commitment. It is derived from the [intermediate encryption key](#intermediate-encryption-key) as follows:

    aek = SHA3-256(0x00 || iek)


### Value Encryption Key

Value encryption key (VEK or `vek`) allows decrypting the amount in the output commitment. It is derived from the [intermediate encryption key](#intermediate-encryption-key) as follows:

    vek = SHA3-256(0x01 || iek)


### Asset ID Blinding Factor

An integer `c` used to produce a blinded asset ID commitment out of a [cleartext asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment):

    H = A + c·G

The asset ID blinding factor is created by [Create Blinded Asset ID Commitment](#create-blinded-asset-id-commitment).


### Value Blinding Factor

An integer `f` used to produce a [value commitment](#value-commitment) out of the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment):

    V = value·H + f·G

The value blinding factors are created by [Create Blinded Value Commitment](#create-blinded-value-commitment) algorithm.


### Issuance Asset Range Proof

The issuance asset range proof demonstrates that a given [confidential issuance](asset-version-2-confidential-issuance-witness) commits to one of the asset IDs specified in the transaction inputs. It contains a ring signature. The other inputs to the [verification procedure](#verify-issuance-asset-range-proof) are computed from other elements in the confidential issuance witness, as part of the [validation procedure](#validate-transaction-input).

The size of the ring signature (`n+1` 32-byte elements) and the number of issuance keys (`n`) are derived from `n` [asset issuance choices](data.md#asset-issuance-choice) specified outside the range proof.

Field                           | Type             | Description
--------------------------------|------------------|------------------
Issuance Ring Signature         | [Ring Signature](#ring-signature)   | A ring signature proving that the issuer of an encrypted asset ID approved the issuance.
Issuance Keys                   | [Public Key]     | Keys to be used to calculate the public key for the corresponding index in the ring signature.
VM Version                      | varint63         | [Version of the VM](#vm-version) that executes the issuance signature program.
Issuance Signature Program      | varstring31      | Predicate committed to by the issuance asset range proof, which is evaluated to ensure that the transaction is authorized.
Program Arguments Count         | varint31         | Number of [program arguments](#program-arguments) that follow.
Program Arguments               | [varstring31]    | Data passed to the issuance signature program.


## Core algorithms



### Create Ring Signature

**Inputs:**

1. `msg`: the 32-byte string to be signed.
2. `{P[i]}`: `n` [public keys](data.md#public-key), points on the elliptic curve.
3. `j`: the index of the designated public key, so that `P[j] == p·G`.
4. `p`: the private key for the public key `P[j]`.

**Output:** `{e0, s[0], ..., s[n-1]}`: the ring signature, `n+1` 32-byte elements.

**Algorithm:**

1. Let `counter = 0`.
2. Calculate a sequence of: `n-1` 32-byte random values, 64-byte `nonce` and 1-byte `mask`: `{r[i], nonce, mask} = SHAKE256(counter || msg || p || j || P[0] || ... || P[n-1], 8·(32·(n-1) + 64 + 1))`, where:
    * `counter` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer,
    * `p` is encoded as a 256-bit little-endian integer,
    * `j` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer,
    * points `P[i]` are encoded as [public keys](data.md#public-key).

2. `e[0], s[0], ... s[n-1]`: ring signature consisting of `n+1` 32-byte little-endian integers.
3. `{P[i]}`: `n` public keys, [points](data.md#public-key) on the elliptic curve.

**Output:** `true` if the verification succeeded, `false` otherwise.

**Algorithm:**

1. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
    1. Define `z[i]` as `s[i]` with the most significant 4 bits set to zero (see note below).
    2. Define `w[i]` as a most significant byte of `s[i]` with lower 4 bits set to zero: `w[i] = s[i][31] & 0xf0`.

During signing the non-forged s-value has its 4 most significant bits set to random bits to make it indistinguishable from the forged s-values.

    3. Adjust the value commitment too: `V = V + extra·G`.
    4. Note: as a result, the total blinding factor of the output will be equal to `q`.
13. [Encrypt Value](#encrypt-value): compute `(ev,ef)` from `(V’, value, f’, vek)`.

## Integration

This section provides an overview for protocol changes in the VM1 and blockchain validation logic necessary to support Confidential Assets.

### VM1

#### 1. New behavior for existing opcodes

* [CHECKOUTPUT](vm1.md#checkoutput): accepts commitments (encoded as 32-byte public keys) for both asset ID and amount arguments. Fails execution if commitment is provided when the corresponding field is nonblinded. Fails execution if raw value is provided, but the field is blinded.
* [ASSET](vm1.md#asset): fails execution if asset ID is blinded.
* [AMOUNT](vm1.md#amount): fails execution if amount is blinded.

#### 2. New introspection opcodes

* [ASSETCOMMITMENT](vm1.md#assetcommitment): returns asset ID commitment, if asset ID is blinded. Fails execution otherwise.
* [VALUECOMMITMENT](vm1.md#valuecommitment): returns value commitment, if amount is blinded. Fails execution otherwise.
* [ISSUANCEKEY](vm1.md#issuancekey): returns public key declared in the [issuance choice context](vm1.md#issuance-choice-context).
