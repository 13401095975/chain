We are a focused team with a product roadmap, so we can't guarantee that a pull request will receive the attention it might deserve.

However, if you've found a way to help out the Chain Core community by submitting a bugfix, we'll do our best to work with you to get your code merged. Please use the following process to contribute:

  1. Open a new issue describing the bug or feature
  2. Receive feedback from Chain staff
  3. Collaborate with Chain staff around the design of the code
  4. Write the patch adhering to Chain's Code Style Guide: https://github.com/chain/chain/blob/main/docs/internal/styleguide.md
  5. Complete legal requirements for Chain's Contributor License

If you have questions about how to contribute, please post in the Chain forum: http://forums.chain.com
