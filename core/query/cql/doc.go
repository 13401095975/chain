Package cql evaluates expressions in the Chain Query Language (CQL).
A CQL query is a boolean expression with zero or more placeholder
values ($1, $2, etc) that are initially unconstrained. The query is
evaluated in an environment (such as a transaction object or a UTXO)
that determines the value of all non-placeholder terms. The query
and its fixed values together constrain the placeholders. Function
Eval finds the set of all placeholder values that satisfy the query.

Expressions in CQL have the following forms:

  Form                     Type     Subexpression types
  expr1 "OR" expr2         bool     bool, bool
  expr1 "AND" expr2        bool     bool, bool
  "NOT" expr               bool     bool
  ident "(" expr ")"       bool     list, bool
  expr1 "=" expr2          bool     any (must match)
  expr1 "!=" expr2         bool     any (must match)
  expr1 "CONTAINS" expr2   bool     set, string
  expr1 ">" expr2          bool     int, int
  expr1 "<" expr2          bool     int, int
  expr1 ">=" expr2         bool     int, int
  expr1 "<=" expr2         bool     int, int
  "(" expr ")"             any      any
  ident                    any      n/a
  placeholder              scalar   n/a
  string                   string   n/a
  int                      int      n/a

  ident is an alphanumeric identifier
  placeholder is a decimal int with prefix "$"
  scalar means int or string
  string is single-quoted, and cannot contain backslash
  int is decimal or hexadecimal (with prefix "0x")
  list is a slice of environments

The environment is a map from names to values. Identifier
expressions get their values from the environment map.

The form 'ident(expr)' is an existential quantifier. The environment
value for 'ident' must be a list of subenvironments. The
subexpression 'expr' is evaluated in each subenvironment, and if
there exists one subenvironment for which 'expr' is true, the
expression as a whole is true.

Queries are statically type-checked: if a subexpression doesn't have
the appropriate type, Parse will return an error.
